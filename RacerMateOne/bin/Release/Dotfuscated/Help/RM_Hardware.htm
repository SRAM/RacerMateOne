		Hardware Configuration</h1>
<p>
		Setting up your hardware is documented in the Hardware Manual and the 
		Setup PDF file supplied on the setup disc you received in your 
		CompuTrainer or Velotron.&nbsp; This page deals mostly with the 
		assignment of your training hardware.</p>
<p>
		If 
		the trainer(s) were turned on when the software was launched, the 
		software will do most of the setup for you.&nbsp; Where this may not be true is if you 
		didn't have the trainer connected or you are a MultiRider Center and you 
		want to reassign the locations of the trainers.&nbsp; We have made every 
		attempt in RacerMate One to minimize any questions regarding setup of 
		your trainer in the software to get you riding with minimal effort on 
		your part.&nbsp; If you need to add 
		or change settings, go to the <a href="Options_Riders.htm">Riders</a> 
		and <a href="Options_Hardware.htm">Hardware</a> pages.</p>
		<h3>RacerMate One and Autodetection of trainers</h3>
		<p>Detecting trainers will begin when you launch RacerMate One.&nbsp; Looking at the 
		image below you will see both Velotron and CompuTrainer coexisting.&nbsp; 
		Both can coexist in the same 
		ride, but most users with have only one or the other.&nbsp;</p>
		<h3>Manually detecting hardware</h3>
<p>If for any reason your trainer hardware was not detected when RacerMate One 
started, you may find the need to manually detect trainers.&nbsp; RacerMate One has two depths of detection.&nbsp; One is to Scan 
		for all new devices and the other is a simple refresh of previously 
found connections. Scanning for new devices is a deep scan and will look for any &quot;new hardware&quot; never 
before 
		detected - like a 5-rider MultiRider center adding 3 more trainers.&nbsp; 
		Refresh connections will do a shallow detection to re-enable 
		connections previously found - like when you forgot to turn the trainer 
		on and launched the software.

<h3>Switching trainer positions</h3>
<p>The autodetection routine can easily find hardware, but it assigns them based 
upon the addresses assigned to the ports by the Windows&#0153 operating system.&nbsp; 
This may not be how you have the trainer situated in your room -- assuming you 
have more than one trainer.</p>
<p>You could easily 
		switch their positions in the <a href="Options_Hardware.htm">Options 
Hardware</a> page by clicking the Identify button next to the 
		&quot;position&quot; you which to assign the trainer to.&nbsp; When prompted, press a key on the 
		Handlebar Controller of the trainer you want in that position and RacerMate 
		One will reassign the trainer to that place.&nbsp; This will mean if you 
		had another trainer assigned to that position, it was also be moved to fill 
		up the vacancy.&nbsp; Just proceed bikes 1-8 until they are all assigned 
		the way you want. </p>
<h3>Switching trainers for special situations</h3>
<p>In some cases, like racing pacers in 3D software, you may want to temporarily 
reassign trainer positions.&nbsp; The reason for this is to accommodate the 
ownership of smart pacers.&nbsp; In short, you may have a situation where you 
have 2 live riders and want 6 pacers - 3 assigned and owned by each live rider.&nbsp; 
It is then necessary to move rider #2 to position 5 so you can assign 3 pacers 
on the pick rider screen to positions 2-4 and positions 6-8.&nbsp; You just need 
to select Identify for position 5 and press a key on the second controller, and 
you're done.&nbsp; This need is outlined in full on the <a href="Pick_Rider.htm">
pick rider page</a>.&nbsp; </p>

<h3>Using the Hardware options as a diagnostic tool</h3>
<p>The drop-down menu for each position shows the Com Port address assigned to 
it by Windows&#0153, the version of the firmware in the trainer, the type of trainer, 
and the calibration of Accuwatt&#0153 value.&nbsp; This is a quick view of hardware 
statistics and can be called upon if you are not communicating to the software.&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
	<li>If nothing shows in the dropdown menu, then the chance is the USB 
	connector is not installed.</li>
	<li>If only the Com address shows, but no trainer, then the communication 
	cable between the USB adapter and trainer may be faulty.</li>
	<li>If you need to know the firmware version for service needs -- it is easy 
	to see.</li>
	<li>Calibration and Accuwatt™ values are shown to make sure you know what 
	they are at any time.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Running the Calibration or Accuwatt test</h3>
<p>You can run either of these tests on the appropriate trainer by pressing the 
Calibrate or Run Accuwatt&#0153 buttons.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The Calibration screen will appear for CompuTrainer and allow you to warm-up 
for 10 minutes and then instruct you what to do next.&nbsp; This is outlined on 
the <a href="Rolling_Calibration_CT.htm">Calibration help page</a>.</p>
<p>The Accuwatt screen will use the Accuwatt value saved in the Velotron onboard 
memory to display the correct results.&nbsp; Instructions will display to 
instruct you on what to do.&nbsp; This is also outline on the
<a href="Accuwatt_VT.htm">Accuwatt&#0153 help page</a>.</p>
<h3>Setting the Velotron&#0153 front chain ring size</h3>
<p>The Velotron&#0153 has a fixed front sprocket and the software needs to know the 
tooth count of this sprocket.&nbsp; This is set on this page.&nbsp; By default 
Velotron&#0153 comes with a 62-tooth front sprocket, but you may also have the 
85-tooth sprocket used on Wingate software.</p>
<p>This setting differs from the <a href="Velotron_Gearing.htm">Rider Tab 
Velotron gear settings</a> because this is an actual hardware setting and the 
Riders tab setup is for the &quot;virtual&quot; gearing setup.</p>
