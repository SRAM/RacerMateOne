<h1>SpinScan - by Bill Edwards</h1>
<p>The following was written by Bill Edwards and was contained in previous 
RacerMate Manuals.&nbsp; Bill is now in the great Velodrome in the sky, but his 
suggestions still live on.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="Help_files/SpinScan.png" width="462" height="334"></p>
<h3>Pedaling Efficiency</h3>
<b></b><font SIZE="3">
<p>Improvements in pedaling efficiency can make it possible to produce power 
with less muscle stress and less fatigue. Many of the world&#39s greatest cyclists 
have worked hard to improve pedaling efficiency using sophisticated scientific 
measurements of pedal pressure. The SpinScan function provides a direct visual 
measure of pedaling efficiency, thereby allowing one to work on improving 
pedaling efficiency by the use of real-time biofeedback. One can actually see 
the immediate effects of modified recruitment patterns on pedaling efficiency.
</p>
<p>Inefficient pedaling causes one to recruit a relatively few leg-muscle fibers 
at high intensity, whereas efficient pedaling technique spreads the load out 
over a great many muscle fibers at a much lower intensity. Muscle fibers fatigue 
very quickly at high intensity, whereas muscle fatigue occurs much more 
gradually at lower intensities. It therefore is an advantage to be able to 
produce power using lower average intensity. </p>
</font>
<h3>The SpinScan Displays</h3>
<font SIZE="3">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are two displays available in the SpinScan function:
</p>
</font>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font SIZE="3">BarGraph </li>
	</font>
	<li>
	<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font SIZE="3">Polar Plot </li>
</ul>
<p>The bar chart displays the torque on the pedals as a function of position on 
the circle, starting with the left foot, and then the right foot. Using the bar 
chart display, the graph of inefficient pedaling can be displayed by &quot;stomping&quot; 
down hard on the pedals one at a time (right-left-right-left, etc.). You will 
see two distinct mountain peaks corresponding to the left and right feet pushing 
down the pedals. At the bottom of the chart you will see three efficiency 
numbers corresponding to the left foot, average of both feet, and right foot, 
respectively. These numbers represent the ratio of the average torque to the 
maximum torque applied to the pedals multiplied by 100.</p>
<p>If you next try rotating the pedals while keeping a constant light pressure 
on the bottoms of your feet all around the entire circle, the graph becomes 
flatter and the peaks less distinct, and you will feel less intense muscle 
stress. You should notice that the efficiency numbers displayed at the bottom of 
the chart have increased. At first, you may find it difficult to maintain this 
circular pedaling technique and increased efficiency for very long, but with 
constant practice it will become second nature. It just takes time for your 
muscle cell firing patterns to adapt and to &quot;learn&quot; the new technique. </p>
<p>The polar display shows the torque around the entire circle of the pedals. 
When &quot;stomping&quot; on the pedals one at a time, the display shows two distinct 
lobes (like an airplane propeller). With circular pedaling, the display becomes 
a nearly perfect circle, and the efficiency numbers will increase. </p>
<p>Another feature displayed on the polar graph is the angle of attack (the red 
lines). The angle of attack is the angle at which maximum torque is applied to 
each pedal. A good target for this angle is 90 degrees (i.e., when the pedal 
cranks are horizontal to the ground). However, this angle depends on saddle 
position and the degree to which one can recruit hamstrings versus quads in the 
power stroke. Sprinters normally prefer to have their saddles more forward, and 
tend to recruit more of the hamstring and hip flexor muscles. Their angle of 
attack will most likely be greater than 90 degrees. For road riders, the 
preferred angle of attack is closer to 90 degrees. For time trial bikes, the 
angle of attack is a compromise between loss of power at the pedals and the gain 
one can achieve by being more aerodynamic.</p>

<h3>Using the SpinScan Function</h3><font SIZE="3">
<p>Typical SpinScan efficiency numbers for cyclists range from as low as 50 
percent or less up to as high as 85-90 percent. However, it is not productive to 
compare your efficiency numbers with those of other cyclists. What is productive 
is to start from where you are now, and work toward improving your efficiency 
from that starting point. Practice makes perfect. </p>
<p>A good way to begin is to try concentrating on improved efficiency by 
lightening up on the pedals for about 3-5 minutes at a time at first. Try 
imagining that you have eggshells under your feet and you mustn&#39t crush them. 
You should be able to wiggle your feet around in your shoes while you are 
pedaling hard. If you try an experiment of using this technique while out on the 
road, you will notice that your speed on the bike will go up by 0.5-1.0 MPH with 
no additional stress. That is what you are looking for. </p>
<p>Be patient, because it takes time to get permanent results, but it&#39s worth 
the effort! </p>
