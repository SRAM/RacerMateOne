<h1>DragFactor&#0153</h1>
<p><a href="Help_files/DragFactor.png">
<img border="0" src="Help_files/DragFactor-small.png" width="462" height="334"></a></p>
<p>DragFactor&#0153 is set in the <a href="Options_Riders.htm">Rider Options</a> page 
as shown in the image above.&nbsp; </p>
<p>DragFactor&#0153 is similar to adjusting your aerodynamic drag coefficient without 
actually having to know what 
your aerodynamic drag coefficient is. Most of us have never been in a 
wind-tunnel, but all of us have ridden on the road.&nbsp; We use the latter as 
the gage to determine how to adjust DragFactor&#0153.</p>
<p>Any course based upon &quot;grade&quot; uses your weight, the road grade, and wind, 
which increases with your speed and any value for wind set in the course, to 
determine the forces you feel at the pedals.&nbsp; The wind component uses 
frontal area to determine this force.&nbsp; RacerMate has used a 
preset &quot;frontal area&quot; for all riders regardless of their height and 
weight.&nbsp; But frontal area determines how much 
wind you have to push when riding a bike down the road, and many riders spend 
countless amounts of money to be aerodynamic while riding - because it is the 
one thing they have some control over.&nbsp; With a fixed 
frontal area a smaller or more aerodynamic rider may not push as much wind as 
the larger, less aerodynamic cyclist, who would push more wind.&nbsp; On the 
RacerMate trainer they were treated equally.&nbsp; Using this tool you can increase or decrease the 
frontal area component, which will adjust the wind-load curve for you when using courses with grade.&nbsp; 
This will adjust the feel of the training system to match the effort of 
you also feel on your actual bike when riding outside.</p>
<h3>Determining your DragFactor&#0153</h3>
<p>To set DragFactor&#0153 requires knowing what to adjust it to. This is best 
accomplished by first doing on-the-road testing to calculate what your speed-to-heart 
rate is on a one-mile flat time-trial and then duplicating the same thing 
indoors.&nbsp; Here's what to do:</p>
<h4>The outdoor test</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Find as flat a 
mile-long section of roadway you can</li>
	<li>Choose a calm windless day to do the test.</li>
	<li>Select a gear on the bike you can maintain for the entire test so 
	your speed and RPM are not changing.</li>
	<li>Ride at a steady 
state in one direction while monitoring your heart rate. Record your heart rate when it has 
stabilized at a fixed speed. </li>
	<li>Now repeat the ride in the opposite direction and 
	record your heart rate. This will eliminate any grade or wind variations, if 
	any. 
	</li>
	<li>Average these two readings to determine what your heart rate is at a 
	given speed on a flat road.</li></ol>
<h4>The indoor test</h4>
<p>Keys used: Fn and up/down keys.</p>
<p><a href="Help_files/PT_DF_Adjust.png">
<img border="0" src="Help_files/PT_DF_Adjust_small.png" width="462" height="334"></a></p>
<p>You can only adjust DragFactor&#0153 in the Power Training, using a grade-based course selection, before the timer has been started.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Launch the Power Training application.<li>Select the rider you want to 
	determine DragFactor&#0153 for.&nbsp; You want to make sure the weight is set 
	correctly for this rider.&nbsp; 
	<li>Select a Distance and Grade course.&nbsp; Course selection does not 
	matter, we will be adjusting the DragFactor&#0153 before the timer or course 
	begins and the warm-up grade is preset at 0%.<li>Press the Start button on 
	the Setup screen to enter the Power Training screen.<li>DragFactor&#0153 can only be adjusted on-the-fly prior to starting a 
	race timer when you are in a grade-based course.&nbsp; Do NOT start the 
	timer.<li>Start riding as you did on the outdoor test, but don't worry about 
	distance.&nbsp; Speed will display, as well as heart rate.&nbsp; Just bring your 
	speed and cadence to the same as it was used on the outdoor ride and allow 
	your heart rate to stabilize.<li>Adjust 
	the DragFactor&#0153 value, as shown in the image above, using the Fn key 
	followed by the up/down arrow keys until your speed and heart rate match what you noted for the 
	outdoor test.&nbsp; Adjusting DragFactor&#0153 will increase or decrease your work 
	effort, so a lower DragFactor&#0153 will lower your heart rate for the same 
	speed 
	(less wind effect) and raising it with raise your heart rate for the same 
	speed (more wind effect).<li>When your speed and heart rate match the outdoor 
	conditions on the trainer, then make note of the final DragFactor&#0153 value.&nbsp; 
	If you press F1 now to start the timer, you will be asked to append your 
	rider profile with this new value, which will then be set for all future 
	rides.<li>You are done.</ol>
</p>
<p>Notes: </p>
<p>DragFactor&#0153 values are saved within performance files to allow verification of 
whether the wattage output is, or isn&#39t, based upon a Drag Factor&#0153 adjustment. </p>
<p>Lower DragFactor™ numbers will show a lower wattage for a given speed -- the 
same way any aerodynamic changes on the bike can lower wattage output on the 
road.</p>
