<h1>CompuTrainer Rolling Resistance Calibration</h1>
<p>
<img border="0" src="Help_files/Setup-CompuTrainer.png" width="462" height="370"></p>
<p>
If you choose to begin a daily ride with a quick warm-up and calibration,&nbsp; 
the above application will allow you and another rider (if applicable) to warm-up on a preset 
course for 10-minutes.&nbsp; At the end of the 10-minutes the program will 
disconnect from the trainer and allow you to calibrate.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
Regardless of whether you calibrate before or during a ride, since both options 
are available, calibration is done using only the Handlebar Controller (as 
noted below).&nbsp; The application of conducting a calibration in RacerMate One 
is primarily for the warm-up part.</p>

<h3>What is Rolling Resistance, or Rolling Drag?</h3>
<p>Rolling Resistance, or rolling drag, is the effort required to spin the tire 
against the roller of the CompuTrainer. It can vary based upon press-on force, 
bearing friction, tire pressure, tire type, spoke windage, and temperature</p>

<h3>What is Rolling Resistance Calibration? </h3>
<p>Rolling Resistance Calibration is used to measure this Rolling 
Resistance (or drag).&nbsp; Its value is measured in pounds. The software uses this 
value along with other mathematical formulas to accurately produce workloads and 
display wattages in both Stand-Alone Operation and while using RacerMate One.</p>

<p>Using the Rolling Resistance Calibration Program before every 
training session will insure accuracy and high repeatability from one training 
session to the next. Once measured and saved, the rolling resistance value will 
remain in the Handlebar Controller memory until the power is turned off. When 
the power is turned off and then on again, the measured rolling resistance value 
will be replaced by the default rolling resistance value of 2.00 lbs and 
recalibration will again become necessary.</p>

<h3>A common misconception</h3>
<p>Because we default to a value of 2.00 pounds, many think this to be an 
optimum value.&nbsp; This is not true.&nbsp; With conventional road tires 2.00 
lbs. might be considered an <b><u>absolute minimum value</u> </b>when riding 
flat courses, but higher values may be needed to eliminate tire slip if grades 
exceed that of a level road.&nbsp; Tire slip is an enemy to accuracy.</p>

<h3>Setting Press-on Force</h3>
<p>Press-On Force is the amount of contact pressure between the tire and the 
friction roller of the <b>Load Generator</b>. Lack of adequate Press-On Force<i>
</i>will cause the tire to slip and too much will add unnecessary friction 
making load levels (the work you do) seem difficult and unrealistic. The amount 
of Press-On Force will determine &quot;minimum rolling drag.&quot; If set too high, the 
bike will always have to work against this rolling drag and will likewise feel 
as though you are climbing a hill, when in fact you may be descending.&nbsp; If 
set too low, the tire will slip and you will not be able to climb steep hills 
without a cogging effect, where you can overcome the contact of the tire to the 
roller of the trainer with the forces you apply at the pedals.</p>

<h4>Tips to prepare for and properly adjust Press-on Force</h4>
<ol>
	<li>You should clean the tire <i><u>daily</u></i> with an evaporating 
	cleaner such as Isopropyl Alcohol (found at any drug store). This will 
	remove the waxy mold release (a compound used to allow easy removal of tire 
	from its mold during manufacture), or road oils. We advise cleaning the tire 
	before every training session and especially after riding outdoors.<u> </li>
	</u>
	<li>Daily check and inflate your tire to its maximum rated tire pressure.
	</li>
	<li>Use an indoor training tire, like the Continental&#0153 HomeTrainer tire.&nbsp; 
	At the very least use a tire with the least amount of visible tread.&nbsp; 
	This will provide for the most &quot;tire to friction roller&quot; contact. Smooth 
	tires are preferable. </li>
	<li>Set the Press-On according to the anticipated maximum workload. More 
	press-on for hill climbing and less for time-trial (flat) courses. </li>
</ol>
<p>Turn the <b>Rear Adjusting Knob </b>located on the <b>Hinge </b>to adjust the
<i>Press-On Force. </i></p>
<p><a href="Help_files/IMG_0043.JPG">
<img border="0" src="Help_files/IMG_0043.JPG" width="400" height="300"></a></p>
<p>Do so until, while holding the <b>Flywheel </b>stationary with one hand and 
using the other hand to pull the tire across the friction roller, the tire no 
longer slips when reasonably strong force is applied. </p>
<p><a href="Help_files/IMG_0108.JPG">
<img border="0" src="Help_files/IMG_0108.JPG" width="400" height="300"></a></p>
<p>Next, check to insure the tire is running true on the friction roller. Do 
this by rotating the tire by hand forwards and then backwards a foot or so. The 
footprint of the tire should stay in the same spot on the friction roller in <u>
both </u>directions. If the tire moves left and right across the roller when it 
is rotated forth and back, the <b>Load Generator Assembly </b>is slightly 
twisted on the <b>Hinge</b>. Slightly loosen the <b>Allen Screw </b>and 
straighten the <b>Load Generator </b>assembly until the tire tracks perfectly.

<h3>Calibration Routine</h3>
<p>The calibration procedure involves pedaling the bike up to 25 M.P.H. (about 
40 K.P.H.) and then coasting to a stop. During the coast down, the Rolling 
Resistance is measured electronically.&nbsp; You can calibrate a few ways as 
described below.</p>
<h4>Using the Calibration Warm-up software</h4>
<ol>
	<li>If you are using RacerMate One to calibrate, turn your 
CompuTrainer <b>ON </b>and launch RacerMate One.&nbsp; You will be asked if you 
want to calibrate.&nbsp; If you have turned this option off, go to Options and 
then to the Hardware setup tab and select Calibrate for the bike you wish to 
calibrate.&nbsp; This will launch the Calibration Warm-up application.<br>
	<br>
	<a href="Help_files/Start_Cal.png">
	<img border="0" src="Help_files/Start_Cal_S.png" width="462" height="334"></a>&nbsp;
	<br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Press F1 to 
begin the timer.&nbsp; At the end of 10 minutes you will be instructed  
to follow the steps as shown below.<br>
	<br>
	<a href="Help_files/Cal_Inst.png">
	<img border="0" src="Help_files/Cal_Inst_S.png" width="462" height="334"></a><br>
&nbsp;</li>
	<li>As noted you will want to repeat the calibration speed-up/slow-down 
	procedures a few times.&nbsp; When satisfied you can press <b>F3</b> to save 
	the value - or if you need to increase or decrease the Press-on Force at the 
	Load Generator, you can do so and then press <b>F1</b> to warm-up 2 more 
	minutes at this setting.</li>
	<li>Once you have saved a calibration value you will get the following image 
	showing the value you are saving.</li>
	<li>If you have not calibrated (didn't speed up to 25, or something) and 
	press F3 to save, the software will display the following message.<br>
	<br>
	<a href="Help_files/Cal_UNCAL.png">
	<img border="0" src="Help_files/Cal_UNCAL_S.png" width="462" height="334"></a><br>
&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<h4>Calibrating during a ride</h4>
<ol>
	<li>During any training session within RacerMate One (timer is running) <b>Press</b> <b>
	F1 </b>to pause the timer and then press <b>F3</b> to enter Calibration mode 
	on the Handlebar Controller. </li>
	<li>Now pedal the bike and as soon as you reach <b>12 m.p.h. </b>the word &quot;UP&quot; will appear on 
the bottom right hand corner of the display. Continue pedaling faster. When the 
speed reaches 25 mph the word &quot;UP&quot; </i>
disappears and you should stop <i><u><b>all</b></u><b> </b></i>pedaling and let the wheel coast to a stop. The rolling resistance measured 
during this test will appear in the top half of the screen. Repeat this step 
about 2 or 3 times to make sure the number repeats +/- a few hundredths of a 
pound. </li>
	<li>When satisfied. save the calibration value by pressing <b>F3</b>. 
The number will automatically replace the default value of <i>2.00 </i>at the 
bottom of the screen. Calibration is now complete. </li>
	<li>Now press <b>F1</b> on the Controller to resume the timer at this new 
	calibration setting.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Calibrating without the use of external software</h4>
<ol>
	<li>If you are not connected to RacerMate One or a computer, 
turn your CompuTrainer on and <b>Press</b> <b>F2 </b>to enter Ergometer mode and 
ride for about 10 minutes after increasing the wattage to 150 watts using the <b>[ 
	up ]</b> key. </li>
	<li>After the warm up using step 1b, press the <b>[ up] </b>and <b>[ down ] </b>keys simultaneously to return to the Calibration Program.&nbsp; In 
RacerMate One, you will automatically enter Calibration mode.&nbsp; In 
Calibration Mode the display will show &quot;U&nbsp; 2.00&quot;
(<i>uncalibrated and defaulted at 2.00 lbs.</i>) in 
the lower half of the display and <i>0.00 </i>in the top half of the display.
	</li>
	<li>Now pedal the bike and as soon as you reach <b>12 m.p.h. </b>the word &quot;UP&quot; will appear on 
the bottom right hand corner of the display. Continue pedaling faster. When the 
speed reaches 25 mph the word &quot;UP&quot; </i>
disappears and you should stop <i><u><b>all</b></u><b> </b></i>pedaling and let the wheel coast to a stop. The rolling resistance measured 
during this test will appear in the top half of the screen. Repeat this step 
about 2 or 3 times to make sure the number repeats +/- a few hundredths of a 
pound. </li>
	<li>When satisfied. save the calibration value by pressing <b>F3</b>. 
The number will automatically replace the default value of <i>2.00 </i>at the 
bottom of the screen. Calibration is now complete. </li>
</ol>
<p>Once saved, the calibration number will remain in memory until the 
CompuTrainer power switch is turned OFF.</p>
<p>Note: A value above <i>5.00 </i>is considered excessive by the software and 
cannot be saved. In this case check for low tire pressure, high press-on force, 
etc. Make adjustments to reduce the rolling resistance to below 5.00 lbs.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">Important Notes: </p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An error during calibration of 0.01 lb. equates to a change 
in load of 1/2 watt at a speed of 25 m.p.h.. You may wish to repeat Step 3 more 
than once to confirm your rolling resistance value repeats to within .05-.10 
lbs. If the value continues to drop for two consecutive measurements, this 
indicates that the tire and Load Generator may have not yet reached a stabilized 
operating temperature. Warm up the system several more minutes and repeat Step 
3. </p>
<p>It is <u><b>not </b></u>necessary that the calibration numbers read <i>
exactly </i>the same on a daily basis, this assuming the values don&#39t vary too 
much, i.e. 2.00 pound compared with 3.00 pounds. Because rolling drag is &quot;always 
there&quot;, setting too much rolling drag for a flat course would make loads feel 
like hill climbs. You should always set the press-on force appropriate to the 
workload to be encountered. If a flat course, then less press-on force. Hill 
climbs will require more. For advice on setting an optimum Press-On Force 
number, see the technical appendix on page 23 of this manual. </p>
