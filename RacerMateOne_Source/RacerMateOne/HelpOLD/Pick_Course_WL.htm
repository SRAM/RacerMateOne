<h1>Pick a Road Course - Grade style</h1>
<p>Course selection has been greatly improved in RacerMate One.&nbsp; Not only 
are we capable of filtering out courses that don't apply to an application, you 
can also sort the courses by name, and distance and total climbing (Alt/Elev).&nbsp; 
This will help you narrow your search for the specific course or difficulty 
level.&nbsp; You can also type into the Find command to search for a specific 
course.&nbsp; Depending on the application you choose, you will have a variety 
of pre-loaded courses to choose from.</p>
<h3>Course selection in 3D Cycling, SpinScan training, and Real Course Video</h3>
<p>Some applications, like 3D Cycling (shown below), SpinScan, and Real Course 
Video, have pre-filtered courses types.&nbsp; Therefore you will not be able to 
select the wrong type of course even though all courses now what the same &quot;RMC&quot; 
file extension.</p>
<p>

<h3>
Course selection in Power Training</h3>
<p>
Power Training can run any course type and has a slightly different course 
selection tool.&nbsp; Course selection in
Power Training, because it is not limited to a specific graphic requirement 
(showing a physical road that hopefully looks realistic), can run any course or 
test imaginable.&nbsp; All courses have a profile - and that is what drives the 
Power Training application.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
Course selection starts first with a selection of the 
course style (in the course drop-down selector to the right of the Browse button).&nbsp; 
This will filter the selection of available courses on that 
course type.</p>
<p>

<h3>Course types</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Grade courses are &quot;windload-based&quot; courses of either &quot;time and grade&quot; or 
	&quot;distance and grade.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; These control the trainer and adjust load 
	based up slope or also called % grade.&nbsp; In other words, the faster you 
	go the more wind you have to push out of the way.&nbsp; Going faster is 
	harder simply due to wind increase.</li>
	<li>ERG courses are &quot;wattage-based&quot; and will be either &quot;time and watts&quot; or 
	&quot;distance and watts.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; These follow a preset wattage and will 
	adjust the trainer as needed to maintain the wattage you are set to at the 
	moment.&nbsp; ERG courses demand as steady a state of your cycling as 
	possible to minimize the adjustments (electronically) to maintain the 
	wattage you are setting.&nbsp; If your pedal RPM is fluctuating by vast 
	amounts, the drive to the trainer also has to try to keep up with you.&nbsp; 
	It may fail if you don't keep your speed and cadence stable.</li>
	<li>%AT courses are also &quot;wattage-based&quot; and will be either &quot;time and %AT&quot; 
	or &quot;distance and %AT.&quot;&nbsp; Like ERG courses these follow a preset wattage, 
	but instead of using a preset wattage it uses what you set as your Anaerobic 
	Threshold wattage and adjusts the load based upon percentages of that value.&nbsp; 
	Also like ERG courses you will want to maintain a very steady RPM. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Changing the list sort</h2>
<p><a href="Help_files/Course_Sort_click.png">
<img border="0" src="Help_files/Course_Sort_click-small.png" width="462" height="334"></a></p>
<p>By default the courses are shown alpha-numerically, but you can sort the list by 
how many laps have been pre-saved into the course, the course length, or total 
climbing or altitude gain as well.&nbsp; </p>
<h3>To change the list sort</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Click on a header (Laps, Miles/Kms, or Alt/Elev) and the course will 
	sort using that selection and will bolden to show they are active.&nbsp; 
	</li>
	<li>To reverse sort, press the same header again.</li>
	<li>To return to alpha-numeric again, click a 3rd time to unbolden a selected header.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notes: </p>
<ul>
	<li>The slider used in RacerMate One doesn't behave like a standard 
	Windows-based slider... as much as we wanted it to.&nbsp; You need to grab 
	the slider and drag it up and down to view the list.&nbsp; It does offer 
	some right-click functions standard (see image below) and we will try to 
	program in standard Windows-based slider functions in the future.</li>
	<li>Courses may need to &quot;populate&quot; the list, which can take a couple minutes 
	if you have a less-than stellar computer.&nbsp; This is an &quot;indexing 
	process&quot; needed to allow the sort and find functions to work.&nbsp; If you 
	are witnessing the slider button growing smaller as you open to a 
	setup/staging page, indexing is in process.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="Help_files/scroll%20bar.PNG">
<img border="0" src="Help_files/scroll%20bar-small.png" width="395" height="334"></a></p>
<h3>Selecting a grade course</h3>
<ol>
	<li>If using Power Training select the drop-down menu above the course list and choose Course 
	(grade).</li>
	<li>Sort the list as indicated above.</li>
	<li>Scroll through the courses and click on any course to select it and 
	display the profile and course data.</li>
	<li>If you are satisfied with the selection, press Start to load the course.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Change Start and End points</h2>
<p>RacerMate One takes course manipulation to another level.&nbsp; You can now 
select start points, end points, reverse selections, add out and backs to a 
selection and save all your changes as a new course.&nbsp; No longer do you need 
to create courses that loop to have multiple laps.&nbsp; Just select the start 
and end points and set the number of laps.&nbsp; You are done.</p>
<p>The following section shows how to change the start and end points only.&nbsp; 
The complete details on manipulating and creating new courses from within 
existing courses can be found in the link show below.</p>
<p><a href="Help_files/PTraining-GradeStartEnd.png">
<img border="0" src="Help_files/PTraining-GradeStartEndsmall.png" width="462" height="334"></a></p>
<h3>Set a start and end point</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Select a course to load it into the profile viewer.</li>
	<li>Hover over the Start post with your mouse and left-click/hold/drag the Start post to the 
	new start position.</li>
	<li>Hover over the End post and left-click/hold/drag the End post to the new 
	end position.</li>
	<li>Pay attention to the distances and values in the balloon to help zero in 
	on the correct position you want these set to.</li>
	<li>You will notice as soon as you drag either the Start or End post, the 
	Save as button will appear.&nbsp; You can opt to save this &quot;edit&quot; as a new course.</li>
	<li>You can select the Zoom tool to help zero in on exactly where you want 
	to start or end.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Zoom into a shortened course</h3>
<p><a href="Help_files/PTraining-GradeZoom.png">
<img border="0" src="Help_files/PTraining-GradeZoomsmall.png" width="462" height="334"></a></p>
<p>When you have set a new Start and End point, you can click on the Zoom tab 
above the course profile to zoom into the course.&nbsp; You will be able to 
fine-tune the Start and End points from this new vantage point.</p>
<h3>Editing a course further before riding it</h3>
<p>As described above, you can edit a course quite a bit before riding it.&nbsp; This is explained in detail on 
the <a href="Course_Profile_Edit.htm">Course Profile edit</a> page.</p>
