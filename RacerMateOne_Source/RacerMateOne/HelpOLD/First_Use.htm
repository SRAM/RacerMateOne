    <td style="width:524px;"><h1>RacerMate One First-use Wizard</h1>
<p>The First Use Wizard 
was designed for the home user who might have one or two 
trainers only.&nbsp; Users with more than this many trainers are considered a professional client 
and will be directed to the location where they can setup their hardware - 
skipping the remaining part of the First-use wizard.&nbsp; The First Use wizard 
will only happen on the first use of the software.</p>
<h2>The First Use wizard steps</h2>
<h3>Hardware detection&nbsp; </h3>
<p>This screen will occur on First-use as well as every subsequent use.&nbsp; </p>
<p><a href="Help_files/Setup-Looking.png">
<img border="0" src="Help_files/Setup-Looking-small.png" width="462" height="334"></a></p>
<ul>
	<li>&quot;Hardware&quot; consists of a USB adapter and/or corresponding port address, 
	and the trainer plugged into it.&nbsp; </li>
	<li>The trainer must be turned on and plugged into the computer to be 
	detected.&nbsp; </li>
	<li>When found, the trainer and the port addressed to it will be stored in a 
	database and subsequent runs of the software will only check for this 
	previously detected hardware.&nbsp; This will speed-up the software launch 
	process on a daily basis and minimize the number of users who miss the 
	importance of setting up the correct port for the trainer.&nbsp; It will now 
	be automatic.&nbsp; </li>
	<li>If new hardware is added at a later date the daily check will not look for it, but 
	there is a provision in the <a href="Options_Hardware.htm">Hardware</a> tab 
	to search for this newly installed hardware - whether it be USB adapter or trainer.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Can't find hardware message</h3>
<p><a href="Help_files/Setup-NoHardwareFound.png">
<img border="0" src="Help_files/Setup-NoHardwareFound-small.png" width="462" height="334"></a></p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Continue without hardware</b>: If you are running the software 
	without your trainer connected, this is the message you will see.&nbsp; You 
	can press the Continue without hardware button to enter the software and 
	play with settings, courses, or run some of the software applications in 
	demo mode.&nbsp; If you think your hardware is connected and you are receiving this message, you 
should first <a href="troubleshoot.htm">check your connections</a> and click Retry.&nbsp; 
	</li>
	<li><b>Rescan all hardware</b>: If you plugged your USB into another port, 
	or replaced it, the communication port address may change.&nbsp; You will 
	need to press this button to search for any newly installed hardware.</li>
	<li><b>Retry</b>: If you discovered a cable was unplugged or the trainer was 
	turned off when you started the software, you can press this button to 
	refresh the connections.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note:&nbsp; If a cable was unplugged or the trainer was off when the software 
launched, you can press Continue without hardware, load the race screen of any 
application, and then plug in the cable or turn on the hardware and if the port 
address was set correctly, it will begin communicating.</p>
<h3>User type</h3>
<p>Depending upon the number of trainers found when launching the software, you 
may be asked what type of user you are.&nbsp; 
If more than two trainers are found during the search you will be sent directly 
to the Hardware Options tab to allow you to setup the hardware manually.</p>
<p><a href="Help_files/Setup-Use.png">
<img border="0" src="Help_files/Setup-Use-small.png" width="462" height="334"></a></p>
<ul>
	<li>If you are a home user it will ask you to enter at least one user to get you started.<br>
	You can setup as many riders as you choose with this method, but this is a 
	basic setup intended to provide just enough information to get you riding on 
	the bike with no failures.&nbsp; You are encouraged to complete your rider 
	data entry in the <a href="Options_Riders.htm">Riders</a> tab within Options 
	to improve the function of other RacerMate functions.</li>
<li>If you own a Gym or race studio, you will first be eventually asked whether you want to 
upload an existing riders.csv from an existing MultiRider application.&nbsp; 
This tool will become available when the <a href="Classic_MultiRider.htm">
Classic MultiRider</a> applications are completed and part of RacerMate One.&nbsp; <br>
You will then be taken directly to the 
	<a href="Options_Hardware.htm">Hardware setup</a> options page where you can 
setup all the hardware as they are placed in your studio.</li>
</ul>
	<h3>Create your riders</h3>
<p>The entire reason for a &quot;first-use&quot; tool is to get you riding as quickly as 
possible.&nbsp; The first-use rider setup allows you to add a few riders into 
the database and do the starting Calibration routine.&nbsp; 
Some features use more information about you than we ask for in the First-run 
wizard, so be sure to 
complete your user profile from the <a href="Options_Riders.htm">Riders tab</a> 
within Options.</p>
<p><a href="Help_files/Setup-Riders.png">
<img border="0" src="Help_files/Setup-Riders-small.png" width="462" height="334"></a></p>
<h3>Calibrate your system?</h3>
<p>When you are done adding riders, you will be asked if you want to <a href="Rolling_Calibration_CT.htm">calibrate 
your (CompuTrainer)</a> or verify your
<a href="Accuwatt_VT.htm">Accuwatt (Velotron)</a>.&nbsp; <br>
It is advised to 
calibrate or check the Velotron on first-use.</p>
<p>
<img border="0" src="Help_files/Setup-Calibrate.png" width="462" height="227"></p>
<p>If you answer yes to the question it will take you to the correct application 
based upon the hardware found.&nbsp; 
<br>
<a href="Rolling_Calibration_CT.htm">Calibrate CompuTrainer</a><br>
<a href="Accuwatt_VT.htm">Check Velotron Accuwatt</a></p>
<p>If you answer no to the request to calibrate, it will take you directly to the Application 
<a href="Launchpad.htm">Launchpad</a>.</p>
<h3>Daily calibration checks</h3>
<p>After the &quot;First-use&quot; of the software, like Hardware detection, you 
will still be asked 
to calibrate a CompuTrainer every time you launch RacerMate One.&nbsp; As 
indicated above, click Yes to be taken to the Calibrate CompuTrainer screen.</p>
<h3>Skip daily calibration request (CompuTrainer only)</h3>
<p>Calibration can be accessed many ways.&nbsp; You may prefer to calibrate your trainer before launching the software using 
Stand-Alone mode; or you may prefer to do it from the <a href="Options_Hardware.htm">
Hardware tab</a>, or you may prefer to do it in the middle of a real ride using 
the in-ride calibration.&nbsp; However you choose to do it, you can check the option &quot;Do not ask me this again&quot; and 
this screen will be skipped and the software will take you directly to the
<a href="Launchpad.htm">Launchpad</a>.</p>
<p>You can turn on daily calibration requests again within the 
<a href="Options_Advanced.htm">Advanced options</a> tab if you ever decide to.</p>
